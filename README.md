# Predicting heart disease or not, using machine learning

Predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease based on given clinical parameters about the patient.  
This is a single notebook project which demonstrates some foundational machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the problem of heart disease classification.  



Apart from the things which were tried in this notebook, there are so many methods and ways to explore a structured dataset and extract insights from it.
